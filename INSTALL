           This package is free software; you can redistribute and/or
           modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.


Preliminary steps for use with Perl versions prior to 5.004:
------------------------------------------------------------

Edit the file "Locations.pm" in this distribution and

  -  remove the line "require Tie::Handle;"

  -  remove the string "Tie::Handle" from the line
     "@ISA = qw(Exporter Tie::Handle);"

Then build and install this package as described below.

Note that you will not be able to use file handles tied to
locations in this case.

Note also that you will not be able to use the module
"Data::Locations::Shell", either!

The rest of the functionality of the "Data::Locations" module
is not impaired by this measure in any way, however.


Installation:
-------------

IMPORTANT:

Unpack and build this distribution OUTSIDE the Perl installation
tree!

After unpacking, change directory to this distribution's directory 
("cd Data-Locations-3.0/").

Then simply install this package using the following commands:

                            % perl Makefile.PL
                            % make
                            % make install


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
