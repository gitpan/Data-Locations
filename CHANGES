New features in version 3.0:
----------------------------

Two new modules have been added to this distribution:
"Data::Locations::Proxy" and "Data::Locations::Shell".

The first is needed for technical reasons only; the latter is a shell
which makes the handling of locations which are tied to file handles
more comfortable:

The advantage of having "Data::Locations::Shell" is that you don't need
TWO object references for the SAME location anymore: One for the location
itself and one for the file handle the location has been tied to.

Instead, you have only ONE object reference you can do everything with:
Use it as a file handle in Perl's built-in functions for dealing with files,
AND use it to invoke methods from the "Data::Locations" class, at the same
time!

Note that "Data::Locations::Shell" needs Perl 5.004 (or higher) in order
to run (whereas "Data::Locations" can do with previous versions of Perl).

Additionally, the two methods "set_filename()" and "get_filename()" have
been replaced by a single method, "filename()". Wether the filename of the
given location is set or returned depends on wether this method is called
with or without a filename argument, respectively.

To adapt your programs, you only need to replace "set_filename" and
"get_filename" by just "filename" using global text search & replace.
That's all.


New features in version 2.0:
----------------------------

In version 2.0, the following new methods and features have been added:

  *  $location->printf($format,@items); # equivalent of the C library "printf"

  *  $item = $location->read();         # to read the contents item by item

  *  @list = $location->read();         # to read the contents all at once

  *  $location->reset();                # reset the pointer for "read()"

  *  Data::Locations->reset();          # reset ALL locations at the same time

  *  $location->tie('FILEHANDLE');      # tie locations to symbolic filehandles

  *  $location->tie($filehandle);       # tie 'em to file handle references...

  *  print @items;                      # do $location->tie('STDOUT'); first!
                                        # (or "select(FILEHANDLE);")
  *  print FILEHANDLE @items;

  *  printf $format, @items;            # (select() and tie() to default first)

  *  printf FILEHANDLE $format, @items;

  *  $item = <FILEHANDLE>;              # to read the contents item by item

  *  @list = <FILEHANDLE>;              # to read the contents all at once

In addition to these new features, the name of this module has been changed
slightly in order to satisfy the naming conventions of CPAN (= Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network) and The Perl 5 Module List:

Use global search & replace to substitute "Data::Locations" for "Locations"
in all your programs that "use Locations;".

Note also that tying locations to file handles requires Perl version 5.004
(or higher), whereas this module is otherwise perfectly happy with previous
versions of Perl 5 as well! (But see the "Preliminary steps for use with
Perl versions prior to 5.004" in the file "INSTALL" in this distribution)


Version history in details:
---------------------------

Version 1.0 was the initial release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 fixed a bug in the detection of potential infinite recursions
(this bug did not cause any malfunction, but increased the time needed for
this check unnecessarily!).

The code was cleaned from left-overs from previous versions, i.e., the
statements "carp - exit" were replaced by "croak", as this is what they
should be.

Finally, the description was changed to make it more accurate and easy
to understand, and the documentation was brushed up at a few places.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In version 2.0, the following new methods were added: "printf()", "read()",
"reset()" and "tie()".

Moreover, a new companion module named "Tie::Handle" has been added to this
distribution which handles the tying of (arbitrary) objects to file handles,
which is used to tie locations to file handles in this case.

This new module allows you to use file handles to write data to and to read
data from locations using the normal Perl syntax for file handles, i.e.,
"print FILEHANDLE @items;" and "$item = <FILEHANDLE>;", to give you just
two examples.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In version 3.0, two new modules have been added to this distribution:
"Data::Locations::Proxy" and "Data::Locations::Shell".

The first is a wrapper for "IO::Handle", the latter inherits from
"Tie::Handle" and is a wrapper around "Data::Locations".

See the manpage of "Data::Locations::Shell" for a list of available
methods and features.

Moreover, the two methods "set_filename()" and "get_filename()" have
been replaced by a single method, "filename()".
