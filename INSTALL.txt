Prerequisites:
--------------

Perl version 5.004 or higher, and an ANSI C compiler. (!)
                                     ^^^^^^
Note that in order to compile Perl modules which contain
C (and/or XS) code (such as this one), you always HAVE
to use the very same compiler your Perl itself was compiled
with.

Many vendors nowadays ship their operating system already
comprising a precompiled version of Perl. Many times the
compilers used to compile this version of Perl are not
available to or not usually used by the users of these
operating systems.

In such cases building this module (or any other Perl
module containing C and/or XS code) will not work. You
will either have to get the compiler which was used to
compile Perl itself (see for example the section "Compiler:"
in the output of the command "perl -V"), or to build
your own Perl with the compiler of your choice (which
also allows you to take advantage of the various compile-
time switches Perl offers).

Note that Sun Solaris and Red Hat Linux frequently were
reported to suffer from this kind of problem.

Moreover, you usually cannot build any modules under
Windows 95/98 since the Win 95/98 command shell doesn't
support the "&&" operator. You will need the Windows NT
command shell ("cmd.exe") or the "4DOS" shell to be
installed on your Windows 95/98 system first. Note that
Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP are not affected
and just work fine. I don't know about Windows Vista and
Windows 7, however.

Note that ActiveState provides precompiled binaries of
this module for their Win32 port of Perl ("ActivePerl")
on their web site, which you should be able to install
simply by typing "ppm install Data-Locations" in your
MS-DOS command shell (but note the "-" instead of "::"
in the package name!).

This also works under Windows 95/98 (!).

If your firewall prevents "ppm" from downloading
this package, you can also download it manually from
http://www.activestate.com/ppmpackages/5.005/zips/ or
http://www.activestate.com/ppmpackages/5.6/zips/.
Follow the installation instructions included in
the "zip" archive.


Installation:
-------------

=============================================================================
ALWAYS unpack and build Perl modules OUTSIDE the Perl source and installation
tree! (You might otherwise inadvertently corrupt your Perl installation!)
=============================================================================

Quick installation guide for experienced users:
-----------------------------------------------

    UNIX:                 Win32/Borland C++:      Win32/MS Visual C++:
    =====                 ==================      ====================

    % perl Makefile.PL    % perl Makefile.PL      % perl Makefile.PL
    % make                % dmake                 % nmake
    % make test           % dmake test            % nmake test
    % make install        % dmake install         % nmake install

Detailed installation guide:
----------------------------

 1) Change directory to the directory that has been created by unpacking this
    package ("cd Data-Locations-5.5").

 2) Type "perl Makefile.PL" (or whatever the name and path of your Perl 5
    binary is).

    This will create a "Makefile" with the appropriate parameters for your
    system (for instance, where the install directories are, and so on).

    See "man ExtUtils::MakeMaker" or "perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for
    other useful options to this command, like setting a different
    installation PREFIX.

 3) Type "make".

    (For installation under Windows NT/95, use "dmake" (Borland C++) or
    "nmake" (MS Visual C++) instead!)

    This will create a dynamically linkable library file that will be linked
    to Perl later, at runtime, provided your system supports dynamic linking.

    Please refer to the MakeMaker documentation for instructions on how
    to build a new Perl with statically linked libraries (invoke "perldoc
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for this), if your system does NOT support dynamic
    linking!

    Should you encounter any compiler warnings or errors (like the redefi-
    nition of certain types already defined by your system), please contact
    me via e-mail at <STBEY@cpan.org>, sending me your compiler output
    (both STDOUT and STDERR). Thank you!

    ======================================================================
       BEWARE that you need an ANSI C compiler in order to successfully
       compile this package!
    ======================================================================

    Also note that problems may arise with the c89 compiler of HP, although
    it allegedly supports ANSI C!

    I recommend the GNU C compiler ("gcc"), which is freely available on
    the Internet (see ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ and mirror sites thereof).

    (HP users are strongly recommended to install the GNU assembler "gas"
    first before installing the GNU C compiler "gcc", according to GNU.)

 4) Now issue "make test" (or "dmake test" or "nmake test", respectively).

    The output should look somewhat like this:

    PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /v/guest/sw/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
    "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/*.t
    t/00____version.t .. ok
    t/01________new.t .. ok
    t/02___refcount.t .. ok
    t/03___filename.t .. ok
    t/04______print.t .. ok
    t/05______loops.t .. ok
    t/06_____printf.t .. ok
    t/07____println.t .. ok

    t/16__example_2.t .. ok
    t/17__example_3.t .. ok
    t/18__example_4.t .. ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=19, Tests=796,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.22 usr  0.09 sys +  0.41 cusr  0.55 csys =  1.28 CPU)
    Result: PASS

 5) At last, type "make install" (or "dmake install", "nmake install").

 6) Share and enjoy!
